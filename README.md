# Histrogram_analysis
Designed and developed a histogram to analyze text data to reveal the relative frequency of the characters that make up an encoded message.
I used frequency and normalization and scaling techniques to adjust the visual representation and make it easy to interpret.
Established parameter providing fair basis for comparison across multiple samples that may be of different sizes. The calculation has the effect of "normalizing" the data.
